    //System.out.println(Emojis.smileyFace)
    static String smileyFace = "\uD83D\uDE0A";//When you copy an emoji, then put it in between quotes like this, it appears as its unicode though when I paste it outside, it appears like this see: üòä
    static String sadFace = "\uD83D\uDE1E";
    static String tick = "‚úÖ";//Ok the emojis can also be stored like this. For some reason, haileti code anymore
    static String cross = "‚ùå";
